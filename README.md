Once this is done, scroll to the bottom of the page and find the area called 'Commit Changes'. In the first field that has sample text of “Update README.MD”, change to something more appropriate i.e., “Added introduction to README file”.
Ensure 'Commit Directly to Main Branch' is selected
Click 'Commit Changes'.
